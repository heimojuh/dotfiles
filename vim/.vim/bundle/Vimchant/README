Vim 7.0 introduced excellent spell-checking features which made external spell-checker plugins pretty much obsolete. Unfortunately not all languages can be supported through Vims dictionary format. Either the language is morphologically too complex or better custom solutions exist already for some languagessolutions which are not compatible with Vims spelling checker. Finnish, for example, is a language which doesnt currently benefit from Vims spell-checking features.

This plugin (Vimchant) provides a simple but fast on-the-fly spelling checker which uses Enchant as its back-end program. Enchant is a spell-checker library and utility included in modern GNU/Linux systems. Enchant itself is only a front-end for many different spell-checkers, including Voikko, Zemberek, Hunspell, Hspell, Uspell, Myspell, Aspell and Ispell. All the spell-checkers and languages which can be supported through Enchant are available to Vim through this plugin.

Manual for Vimchant is included, just type

    :help vimchant.txt

The most interesting commands are \ss (spell-checker on/off) and \sl (change language). The default interval period before running the spell-check is rather long (4 seconds). To make the spell-checker respond faster (1 second, for example) add the following line to your .vimrc file:

    set updatetime=1000
